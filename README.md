# GPT Bot
A basic Slack bot built using the OpenAI API and Slack Bolt.

## Configuration
To run this app, three environment variables must be set:

### OPENAI_API_KEY
The API key generated for your account on [openai.com](https://beta.openai.com/docs/introduction/overview)
At time of writing (January 2023), new accounts on openai are given 18 dollars of free credit to start. Depending on the model, this will allow for a slack bot to be used semi-frequently without problems. I have only burned ~1 cent of credit using the davinci model so far.

### SLACK_BOT_TOKEN
The token for your slack bot generated by [api.slack.com]

### SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET
The secret signing key generated for your slack bot at [api.slack.com]

# Deployment
This repo is configured to deploy seamlessly to the Heroku platform
1. Create a new project on Heroku, select Deployment Pipeline with GitHub, and select this repo
2. Go to the project settings tab, and set the three configuration variables listed above
3. Go to [api.slack.com]
4. Create a new app, name it whatever you want
5. Give your app the following scopes in the Oath and Permissions tab: channels:read, chat:read, chat:write, chat:write.public
6. Go to the Event Subscriptions tab and add the following Request URL: https://your-app.herokuapp.com/slack/events
7. Subscribe your bot to the app_mention event

You're done! Type a message like this into your slack workspace and your bot should reply:
"@your-slack-bot Why do some people dislike Marvel movies?"
