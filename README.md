# GPT Bot
A basic Slack bot built using the OpenAI API and Slack Bolt.

## Configuration
To run this app, four environment variables must be set:

### OPENAI_API_KEY
The API key generated for your account on [openai.com](https://beta.openai.com/docs/introduction/overview)
At time of writing (January 2023), new accounts on openai are given 18 dollars of free credit to start. Depending on the model, this will allow for a slack bot to be used semi-frequently without problems. I have only burned ~1 cent of credit using the davinci model so far.

### SLACK_BOT_TOKEN
The token for your slack bot generated by [api.slack.com](api.slack.com)

### SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET
The secret signing key generated for your slack bot at [api.slack.com](api.slack.com)

### SLACK_APP_TOKEN
You can generate this by activating socket mode for your app on [api.slack.com](api.slack.com)

# Deployment (Socket, platform independent)
1. Go to [api.slack.com](api.slack.com)
4. Create a new app, name it whatever you want
5. Give your app the following scopes in the Oath and Permissions tab: channels:read, chat:read, chat:write, chat:write.public
6. Activate Socket Mode
7. Subscribe your app to the app_mention event
8. Pull the socket branch to your local machine
9. Set the following 4 environment variables (locally): OPENAI_API_KEY, SLACK_BOT_TOKEN, SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET, SLACK_APP_TOKEN
10. Install your app to the slack workspace
11. Run your app using ```python app.py```

You're done! Type a message like this into your slack workspace and your bot should reply:
"@your-slack-bot Why do some people dislike Marvel movies?"
